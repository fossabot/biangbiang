### Methods

#### Dictionary

##### `define(word, dictionary)`

Get the pinyin and definition of a word, where dictionary is "simplified", "traditional", or "merged". Also returns the frequency index (rank).

```javascript
define('面条', 'simplified')

{
    simplified: '面条',
    traditional: '麵條',
    pinyin: 'mian4 tiao2',
    definition: 'noodles',
    index: 6029
}
```

##### `kind(character)`

Check if a character is a traditional or simplified one. If so, returns the other form. `type` is `1` for simplified, `2` for traditional, and `3` for both.

```{javascript}
kind("面")

{ type: 1, other: '麵'}
```

##### `wordsContaining(character)`

Get a list of all dictionary words containing a character, sorted in order of decreasing frequency.

```javascript
wordsContaining('面')

[
	{
	    word: '面',
	    index: 322
	},
	{
	    word: '里面',
	    index: 706
	},
	{
	    word: '面对',
	    index: 930
	},
	{
	    word: '外面',
	    index: 1234
	},
	{
	    word: '后面',
	    index: 1270
	}
	...
]
```

#### Frequency

##### `characterFrequency(character)`

Get frequency statistics for a character.

##### `wordFrequency(word)`

Get frequency statistics for a word.

##### `multiFrequency(sentence)`

Get frequency statistics for a body of text.

#### Components

##### `decompose(character, depth)`

Decompose a character into its components up to a specified depth. If depth is left undefined, then the full component tree is returned.

##### `charactersWithComponent(component)`

Get a list of characters containing a component, sorted in order of decreasing frequency.

## How it works

JSON files containing character/word/component information are generated by [/src/prepare.js](https://github.com/kevinhu/biangbiang/blob/master/src/prepare.js) from raw files contained in [/data/raw](https://github.com/kevinhu/biangbiang/tree/master/data/raw), with outputs saved to [/data/processed](https://github.com/kevinhu/biangbiang/tree/master/data/processed). 

The preparation script can also be run with `npm run prepare` or `yarn prepare`.
